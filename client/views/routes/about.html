        <p>Corina has been looking at the world through a lens ever since she received a Brownie Camera at the tender age of six. Her love affair with photography has been thriving for 26 years, though she graduated from her Brownie a number of years ago. Corina has photographed extensively across North America, Europe, and the Middle East, documenting intimate, inspiring, and compelling moments of the people and places she encounters through her travels. Her work has been published in Vita.MN, City Pages Minneapolis, and Successful Farming Magazine. In 2013, her “Self Portrait” appeared in a national juried show for the Minneapolis Photo Center. She is deeply involved in Twin Cities music and yoga spaces, having worked in the last decade with artists and yogis such as Rod Stryker, Kathryn Templeton, Tanya Boigenzahn, ParaYoga, Devanadi School of Yoga & Ayurveda, Jacqueline Ultan, Carnage, Dark Dark Dark, Caroline Smith and the Good Night Sleeps, Saltee, and Punch Bros. In September 2014, she wrote and directed the music video for “Used To Be Mine” by Sarah Morris, featured on City Pages’ Local Frames blog as a “must-see” music video of the week. Her studies in literature and photography at the University of Minnesota—Morris strengthened her skills in the art of storytelling through images, including mentorships with Jess Larson, Therese Buchmiller, and Joel Eisinger. Further learning with Michael Crouser and Rich Ryan has developed her expertise and earned her critical acclaim within the Minneapolis artistic community. Corina currently resides in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and specializes in music, documentary, and editorial photography.</p>
